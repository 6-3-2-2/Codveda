## 📂 Project List

### 🎲 1. Number Guessing Game (Basic)
- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.  
- The player makes guesses, and the program responds with feedback (*Too high / Too low*).  
- The game ends when the number is guessed correctly or after the maximum number of attempts.  

**Skills learned:**  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Random number generation (`random` module)  
- Handling user input

### 🌍 2. API Integration (Intermediate)
- A Python script that connects to a **public API** (e.g., cryptocurrency prices).  
- Fetches and parses JSON data.  
- Displays results in a user-friendly format.  
- Includes error handling for invalid requests or failed responses.  

**Skills learned:**  
- Working with the `requests` library  
- Parsing JSON responses  
- External API interaction in Python

### 🔐 3. File Encryption/Decryption (Advanced)
- A Python program that encrypts and decrypts text files using the **Fernet encryption algorithm**.  
- Ensures sensitive data is stored securely.  
- Provides functionality to recover original content through decryption.  

**Skills learned:**  
- File handling in Python  
- Basics of cryptography and data security  
- Using the `cryptography` library
